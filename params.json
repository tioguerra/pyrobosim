This simulator is not designed for performance, our focus is on easy usage allowing for fast code development specially in educational scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nTo download the simulator, just download the latest development version from GitHub:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/tioguerra/pyrobosim.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to run the simulator you need to make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. We tried to keep dependencies at a minimum. In order to be able to run this simulator you will need:\r\n* A standard installation of Python 2.7.x with NumPy\r\n* [Open Physics Engine compiled with Python bindings](http://ode-wiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual:_Install_and_Use#Install_with_Python_bindings)\r\n* [VTK 5.x with its Python bindings](http://www.vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html)\r\n\r\nObs.: Depending on your system it is likely that you will also need to install [Cython](http://cython.org/) and maybe some other dependencies.\r\n\r\nTo test if your system is ready do the following\r\n```\r\n$ python\r\n> import ode\r\n> import vtk\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you do not see any error message, then you are ready to go!\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n1. Start the server in a terminal\r\n```\r\n$ python server.py 8888\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Start the client in another terminal:\r\n```\r\n$ python client.py 127.0.0.1 8888 8889\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nThis program is being developed by:\r\n* Rodrigo da Silva Guerra (@tioguerra)\r\n* Marcelo Canaparro\r\n* Leandro Tom√© Martins\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
